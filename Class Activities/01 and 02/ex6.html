<h1>Tags and Classes which Can be Used in A Website for a School</h1>
<ol type="1">
    <li>A class for exams</li>
    <li>A class for timetables</li>
    <li>Tables</li>
    <li>The class for assignments</li>
    <li>Link tags</li>
    <li>The div tag to define the divisions of the documents</li>
    <li>The ordered list tag</li>
    <li>The unordered list tag</li>
    <li>The blockquote tag</li>
    <li>The br tag to define line breaks</li>
    <li>The caption tag to caption the tables</li>
    <li>The cite tag so you can cite your work</li>
    <li>The dialog tag to define dialog boxes</li>

</ol>
    The CSS code required to style tags is like this
    .assignments {<br>
    font-family: times new roman;<br>
    font-size: 10pt;<br>
    font-weight: bold;<br>
    color: purple;<br>
    }<br>

Then when you are ready to style the assigments, you reference it like this:<br>
< p class="assignments">Assignments< /p>"

It would be extemely time consuming for each teacher to have their own styles. Because of this, it is preferable
to have predetermined styles made in CSS so that it carries over throughout your document and also to give the
HTML document a polished look and uniformity.
